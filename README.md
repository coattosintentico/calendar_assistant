# calendar_assistant

A script that reads today's events from a Google Calendar account, converts the text to sound and says them to the user. 

## Credentials

The credentials to access to the user's google account have to be made first following the steps [from this page](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python).

Runs completely in terminal.
